# Decision Making at Stop Signs
In this project, we implemented obstacle avoidance and localization algorithms as well as navigation planning to allow an F-1/10th miniature robotic car autonomously navigate real world environments. Additionally, we provide support for object detection and an AI behavior tree that allows us to consistently handle complex stop sign scenarios.
